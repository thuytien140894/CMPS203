# WHILE
 
This program implemented an interpreter for the abstract syntax tree of WHILE. 
The AST of WHILE is defined as:

        AExp ::= Num Int          
                 Var String
                 Add AExp AExp
                 Sub AExp AExp
                 Mult AExp AExp
                 Div AExp AExp 
        
        BExp ::= Tru
                 Fls
                 Equal AExp AExp
                 Less AExp AExp
                 Not BExp
                 And BExp BExp
                 Or BExp BExp

        Stm  ::= Skip
                 Assign String AExp
                 Seq Stm Stm 
                 If BExp Stm Stm
                 While BExp Stm
                 For Stm BExp Stm

Note: An additional feature added to WHILE is the for command.

To run this program, make sure that Haskell and the Stack build tool are installed 
on the system. 

**1. How to install Stack** 
    
   For Unix operating systems, run one of these commands:  

        curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh  
         
   or   
   
        wget -qO- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh  

   If [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is available, run:
   
        brew install haskell-stack  
        
   For Windows, download and install [Windows 64-bit Installer](https://www.stackage.org/stack/windows-x86_64-installer)  

**2. How to build the program**

   Go to the program directory, then run the following command:  
   
        stack build 

**3. How to run tests on the program**

   Run the command:  
   
        stack test 

   The test cases can be found under the "test" directory. There are three different files 
   for evaluation of arithmetic expressions, boolean expressions, and commands.
